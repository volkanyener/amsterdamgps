# Formal Assessment Rules

#### You're on your own for this one

- You are required to do formal assessments individually.
- You are not allowed to receive external help in any way while doing this assignment

#### Passing grade:

45 / 60 points

#### Start time / Deadline

- The start time and deadline should be listed in the specific assessment `BRIEFING.md` you are taking
- Commits made after the deadline will be excluded from the evaluation

#### Intellectual honesty

- You are allowed to use any materials in the reader or on the internet.
- When asked, you either have to be able to explain your code or reference the source where you found it.
- If you found some code on the internet and used it, put a link in your `REFERENCES.md` to the stackoverflow post or documentation where you found it.
- Copying code from the internet without a reference in `REFERENCES.md` will be considered plagiarism
- Copying code from an assignment submission of another student and passing it off as your own will be considered plagiarism
- As stated in the trainee-ship contract, plagiarism result in an invoice for the course: â‚¬280 for each day of the course.

#### Don't tempt others to plagiarize

- If your app is pushed to a `public` repository you automatically fail this assessment.
- If you discuss the assessment in a slack channel / discord server you automatically fail this assessment.
- Do not make this assessment public in other ways like posting the briefing or deploying this app
- Do not make this assessment public at a later date (do not use it for your portfolio)

#### Your app has to work

- If the evaluator has to edit the source code to be able to start the app you will receive a penalty as it is hard to distinguish whether a candidate would have been able to fix these bugs themselves.
  - One or two points per line of code that has to be fixed, depending on how much has to change, with a maximum of 10 points
- If your project uses dependencies that are not present in the package.json you will receive a 1 point penalty per missing dependency. So make sure you add globally installed dependencies to the package.json of the project as well.
- If you app will not start because of OS specific settings no penalties will apply.

#### Submitting your homework

- You're expected to submit your homework as 2 separate, `private` git repositories: client & server

#### Additional documentation to submit along with the assessment

- Your frontend repo should contain 5 markdown documents
- `RULES.md` (this document)
- `BRIEFING.md` (the briefing of your assessment)
- `ASSESSMENT.md` (your self assessment rubric)
- `REFLECTION.md` (your 200 ~ 300 word self reflection)
- `REFERENCES.md` (a document where you reference the resources you've used)

#### Add evaluators

- Add the evaluators to your repositories as a `collaborator` (if you don't know who the evaluators will be: ask)

#### Second opinion

- As per CRBKO rules you can request a second opinion from another teacher if you disagree with your evaluation. To request reevaluation send an email to: teachers@codaisseur.com
